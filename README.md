# E-Learning Courses

# LIVE HERE : https://e-learning-courses-pro-1.web.app/

This project is an E-Learning Information System for professors to start virtual meeting and courses with React JS / TypeScript / JSON / Material UI / Prime React / ESLint / CSS / Jitsi Meet External API.

All screen size are handled except for extra small screen size.
I put some data in a JSON file to make the app reactive to data and make it a dynamic application instead of a satic one.
I used the best react practices to develop the E-Learning Courses app.
For the deployement I built the project with the `yarn build` commande and I deployed with Firebase, here the documentation for hosting and deploying your app in Firebase : https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/quickstart.

Jitsi Meet is an alternative for ZOOM or GOOGLE MEET... It's an application used to start online meetings I used the hosted one and here is the documentation for Jitsi Meet External API : https://jitsi.github.io/handbook/docs/dev-guide/dev-guide-iframe
And the Jitsi Meet API Github : https://github.com/jitsi/jitsi-meet.

## How to run

### Install Node.js plateform

( Choose the LTS version recommanded for most users )

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install --global yarn`

to install the yarn package it's a better alternative of npm.

### `yarn install`

To install all dependencies.

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### You can start using the application with all its features :)

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
